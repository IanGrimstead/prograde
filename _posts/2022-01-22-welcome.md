Hello! Welcome to **prograde**, a blog about the ML/CV side of my work.

This blog was started as a mirror to [**Retrograde**](https://dr-grim.github.io/retrograde/), my blog series about various things 8-bit from the 1980's; in comparison, **Prograde** will be about the more modern side of things - such as Docker, TensorFlow et al.
